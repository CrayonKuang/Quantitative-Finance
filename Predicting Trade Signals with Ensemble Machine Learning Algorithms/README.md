# Predicting Trade Signals with the use of Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms
Trading indicators are popularly used by traders to identify trends, momentum as well as potential entry points. However, more often than not, these trading indicators will generate false signals due to time lags or other reasons. Trading based on these false signals could result in significant financial losses.
To address this, we hope to use machine learning algorithms to learn from these trading indicators and generate more accurate trading signals. This is a run down of our project.
1. Obtain stock prices using the 'y-finance' package
2. Generate trading signals using SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, RSI and Stochastic Oscillator trading indicators.
3. Generate 'perfect' signals that our models should learn to predict.
4. Use bayesian optimisation to optimise the hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth) of our random forest classifier.
5. Train the random forest classifier using the signals generated by the 5 indicators and predict future trading signals using new stock data.
